# Account-history features for social bot detection in the era of large language models

Code, result tables, and figures accompanying the paper of the same title (Katyal 2026).

The paper evaluates whether account-history features (account age, follower and friend counts, profile completeness, screen-name structure) can substitute for content features in social bot detection when bot operators use language models to launder their text. On a publicly redistributed corpus of 2,432 labeled Twitter accounts, a random forest using only behavioral features achieves ROC-AUC 0.977 in five-fold cross-validation, against 0.830 for a content-only baseline. Behavioral performance is invariant under realistic text rewriting; content performance degrades from AUC 0.842 to 0.785.

## Repository contents

code/      Five scripts (Python + Node.js) that reproduce the full analysis
results/   Ten result tables (CSV) and two summary files (JSON)
figures/   Five paper figures (PNG)

## Headline results

| Model            | ROC-AUC (5-fold CV) | Brier | FPR   | FNR   |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| RF-Content       | 0.830 (0.017)       | 0.155 | 0.130 | 0.322 |
| RF-Behavioral    | 0.977 (0.003)       | 0.055 | 0.034 | 0.118 |
| RF-Fusion        | **0.981 (0.003)**   | 0.050 | 0.022 | 0.102 |

DeLong's test for paired AUC on the held-out test split:

* Behavioral vs Content: z = 9.36, p < 0.001
* Fusion vs Behavioral: z = 2.67, p = 0.008 (difference in AUC: 0.003)

Adversarial robustness, text-rewriting protocol at severity 1.0:

* Content: AUC 0.842 to 0.785
* Behavioral: 0.981 to 0.981 (invariant)
* Fusion: 0.984 to 0.984 (essentially invariant)

Adversarial robustness, feature-space protocol (upper bound on attack strength):

* Content: AUC 0.842 to 0.466 (below chance)
* Behavioral: 0.981 to 0.981 (invariant)

## Reproducing the analysis

Dependencies:

* Python 3.9+ with pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn
* Internet access on first run, to download the dataset from GitHub

The two analysis scripts are independent and can be run in either order:

```bash
cd code/
python3 run_analysis.py     # Tables 1-4, Figures 1-4, TwiBot-20 cross-dataset scoring
python3 run_extended.py     # Tables 5-10, Figure 5 (calibration)
```

`features.py` is imported by both and defines the 36-feature engineering pipeline. `regen_figures.py` regenerates the figures with the titles used in the paper. `build_paper.js` is the Node.js script that builds the manuscript itself from the result CSVs and is included for completeness; it is not needed to reproduce the analysis.

## Data sources

Primary dataset, labeled: 2,432 Twitter accounts, 43% bots, manually annotated. Downloaded from the `jubins/MachineLearning-Detecting-Twitter-Bots` repository on GitHub. Direct URL:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jubins/MachineLearning-Detecting-Twitter-Bots/master/FinalProjectAndCode/kaggle_data/training_data_2_csv_UTF.csv
```

Secondary dataset, unlabeled, used for qualitative cross-dataset validation: the 100-account public sample of TwiBot-20 (Feng et al. 2021). Downloaded from the `BunsenFeng/TwiBot-20` repository on GitHub.

The full labeled TwiBot-20 and TwiBot-22 benchmarks are gated behind an application process administered by the dataset maintainers and are not required to reproduce the results in this repository.
